Terminal used for this: Ubuntu

#### What does the code do?:
1. Create a folder with your project name.
2. Enter the project folder.
3. Converting the folder to a Git repository.
4. Create the first file.
5. `git add` the file and check `git status` to check if the file is in staging.
6. `git commit` the file with your message.
7. `git push` the project with permissions. If you choose not to, the code ends here and you can continue to work on the project before manually pushing to Github.
